mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as ebx + ecx * 4.  If ecx is large enough, this could result in an integer overflow, causing the effective address to wrap around and point to an unexpected memory location.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities (e.g., accessing sensitive data outside of the program's allocated memory).
